    <!--
        The aim in this page is to have a vertical scrollbar for a component,
        when the scrollable component 
        - doesn't have a fixed height or max-height .
        - is deeply (?) nested inside a component with 100vh.
        - we want the scrollable component to use all the remaining vertical space.
        - there are also other sibling components above it.
        - one parent component has display:grid to create columns.

        The only way I've found to accomplish this is to use flex in all
        intermediate components, with flex-grow set to 1.

        The scrollable component has flex-grow set to 1 as well, and also
        flex-basis set to 0 so that the height doesn't start with the full
        height of the contents. If flex-basis isn't set, the scrollbar doesn't
        appear!
        
        As for the intermediate component with a grid, it must have flex-grow
        set to 1 as well.
